# Internship Assessment

This repository contains a technical assessment for evaluating your proficiency in building JavaScript applications using ReactJS. The objective of this assessment is to build a simple to-do application that utilizes local storage as the database for persistent data.

## Requirements

- Users should be able to add and delete tasks.
- Each task should have a title, description, and status (completed or not).
- The status of tasks should be toggleable.
- The application should utilize LocalStorage for data persistence. Refer to this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) for more information on LocalStorage.
- Emphasis should be placed on functionality rather than UI.
- The application should be built using ReactJS and hosted on CodeSandbox. You can find the CodeSandbox link [here](https://codesandbox.io/). Make sure your CodeSandbox link is public and accessible.

## Timeframe

You have 72 hours to complete the assessment.

## Assessment Criteria

Your assessment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Code quality (clean, concise, and maintainable)
- Functionality (meeting all requirements)
- User experience (ease of use and visual appeal)
- Best practices (proper utilization of ReactJS and LocalStorage)

## Submission

Please submit your CodeSandbox link [here](https://forms.gle/Ebn5jM3mTVcQzFyY7) before the deadline.

Good luck! If you have any questions, please send an email to hello@webboss.tech.

## Getting Started with Create React App

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

* Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
* A GitHub account.
* A web hosting service where you can deploy your React app (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

1. Go to the GitHub repository that contains your React app.
2. Click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
4. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
5. Run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied in step 2.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory using the terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to install the app's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the React App Locally

1. After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to build the React app:
```
npm start
```
2. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

### Step 4: Choose a Hosting Service

1. Select a web hosting service where you want to deploy your React app. Some popular options are Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages.
2. Sign up for an account on the chosen hosting service if you haven't already.

### Step 5: Deploy to the Hosting Service

1. Follow the hosting service's documentation to deploy your React app.
2. Generally, the process involves connecting your GitHub repository to the hosting service and configuring the deployment settings.
3. Make sure to specify the build folder (created in step 3) as the deployment source.

### Step 6: Access Your Deployed React App

1. Once the deployment process is complete, the hosting service will provide you with a URL where your React app is hosted.
2. Open a web browser and enter the URL to access your deployed React
